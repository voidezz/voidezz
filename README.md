# I'm sorry.

I think it is that time where I stop developing this client. After half of an entire year of coding and building this client, I believe that it is time I stop and focus on something else. I have decided that I will be making another client, but this one is dead. 

## FAQ

### Why did you stop?
I have stopped because I am working on other projects outside of minecraft hacks and I am becoming more of an actual developer.

### Will you ever come back?
I have no plans to ever come back to this client as of today 4/20/23, but a big maybe in the **Future**.

### Will your new client be public? 
Most likely not, it will probably be private with super limited access which is what Calypso was at first. The earliest version of Calypso that I have is version 1.2.0 which is the second earliest version.
